&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúTo write, you have to want something to survive you.‚Äù -Elena Ferrante&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;August marks the one year anniversary of my first &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/&quot;&gt;Medium&lt;/a&gt; post. It took me &lt;em&gt;weeks&lt;/em&gt; to work up the guts to publicly share my writing. Ever since my elementary school days, I&amp;#39;ve been praised for my way with words. I floated through high school and college on a sea of A&amp;#39;s in humanities courses. So what held me back from pressing &amp;quot;publish&amp;quot;?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fear that my words would be for naught made me nervous. Everything else I&amp;#39;d ever written had a clear-cut audience ‚Äì like a journal entry or a professor-assigned exegesis ‚Äì but forecasting whether my &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/ladies-storm-hackathons/the-gender-gap-as-told-by-data-71dfce420519&quot;&gt;first blog post&lt;/a&gt; would be of any help was daunting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the past year, I&amp;#39;ve learned and then reaffirmed that writing is as much for others as it is for me. &lt;strong&gt;I like my writing best when it has the dual purpose of helping me self-reflect and helping others learn something new&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m about to embark upon a new phase of my life: my first full-time job. I believe that any big change in one&amp;#39;s life demands self-reflection, and, for me, that means writing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s why I&amp;#39;m starting &lt;strong&gt;Chronicles of a Junior Dev&lt;/strong&gt;. Welcome! üëã&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chronicles of a Junior Dev will be a biweekly log of experiences, mishaps, and takeways from my first year as a software engineer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I believe that beginners‚Ää‚Äî‚Äälike me, a new grad engineer‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääshare the best advice because they remember exactly what it‚Äôs like to start from the bottom.&lt;/strong&gt; I‚Äôll use Chronicles of a Junior Dev as a place to document my on-the-job growth for my own sake and, most importantly, in the hopes that budding engineers can learn from me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So join me in my journey from software engineering novice to... well, who knows? Expect new installments in this nail-biter of a life story on every other Monday. üôÄ&lt;/p&gt;

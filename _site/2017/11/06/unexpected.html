    <p>Thanks to my hasty decision to do <a href="https://nanowrimo.org/">NaNoWriMo</a>, Iâ€™ve been working on another blog post this weekend that doesnâ€™t quite fit the theme of <em>Chronicles</em>. Iâ€™ll hopefully cross-publish that on <a href="https://medium.com/">Medium</a> and <a href="https://dev.to/">dev.to</a> later this week.</p>

<p>So, in this chronicle, I have something succinct to share: one quirky, unexpected software engineering epiphany that I had this week.</p>

<p><strong>Work where the employees dress up for Halloween.</strong></p>

<p>At least in the Bay Area, software engineers can take their pick of companies to work for. How can an engineer distinguish which company would make them happiest? Iâ€™d argue that, though salary helps,  company culture has a significant impact on an engineerâ€™s contentment and personal growth.</p>

<p>Company culture is an admittedly difficult-to-measure trait. During the interview process, it feels difficult to assess how a company treats its employees as well as how they treat one another.</p>

<p>One solution: interview on Halloween like I did at Medium! Kidding, of course, but during my interview I noticed something: when a company allows its employees to dress up in costume, it affirms its employeesâ€™ values and passions. It supports self-expression. It signifies that employees can bring their whole selves to work.</p>

<p>Although you shouldnâ€™t let a companyâ€™s blowout Halloween party sway you to take an offer, consider probing your interviewer with questions about the little things that make life at a company enjoyable. Learning about how a company handles Halloween is a great way assess its community and culture, which both impact an engineerâ€™s ability to succeed in their job.</p>

<p>Even though October is over, I hope that the spookiest holiday of the year brings you the most splendid of jobs. ðŸ‘» ðŸŽƒ</p>

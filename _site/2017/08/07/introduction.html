<p>‚ÄúTo write, you have to want something to survive you.‚Äù -Elena Ferrante</p>
</blockquote>

<p>August marks the one year anniversary of my first <a href="https://medium.com/">Medium</a> post. It took me <em>weeks</em> to work up the guts to publicly share my writing. Ever since my elementary school days, I&#39;ve been praised for my way with words. I floated through high school and college on a sea of A&#39;s in humanities courses. So what held me back from pressing &quot;publish&quot;?</p>

<p>The fear that my words would be for naught made me nervous. Everything else I&#39;d ever written had a clear-cut audience ‚Äì like a journal entry or a professor-assigned exegesis ‚Äì but forecasting whether my <a href="https://medium.com/ladies-storm-hackathons/the-gender-gap-as-told-by-data-71dfce420519">first blog post</a> would be of any help was daunting.</p>

<p>Over the past year, I&#39;ve learned and then reaffirmed that writing is as much for others as it is for me. <strong>I like my writing best when it has the dual purpose of helping me self-reflect and helping others learn something new</strong>.</p>

<p>I&#39;m about to embark upon a new phase of my life: my first full-time job. I believe that any big change in one&#39;s life demands self-reflection, and, for me, that means writing.</p>

<p>That&#39;s why I&#39;m starting <strong>Chronicles of a Junior Dev</strong>. Welcome! üëã</p>

<p>Chronicles of a Junior Dev will be a biweekly log of experiences, mishaps, and takeways from my first year as a software engineer.</p>

<p><strong>I believe that beginners‚Ää‚Äî‚Äälike me, a new grad engineer‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääshare the best advice because they remember exactly what it‚Äôs like to start from the bottom.</strong> I‚Äôll use Chronicles of a Junior Dev as a place to document my on-the-job growth for my own sake and, most importantly, in the hopes that budding engineers can learn from me.</p>

<p>So join me in my journey from software engineering novice to... well, who knows? Expect new installments in this nail-biter of a life story on every other Monday. üôÄ</p>

> “To write, you have to want something to survive you.” -Elena Ferrante

August marks the one year anniversary of my first [Medium](https://medium.com/) post. It took me *weeks* to work up the guts to publicly share my writing. Ever since my elementary school days, I've been praised for my way with words. I floated through high school and college on a sea of A's in humanities courses. So what held me back from pressing "publish"?

The fear that my words would be for naught made me nervous. Everything else I'd ever written had a clear-cut audience – like a journal entry or a professor-assigned exegesis – but forecasting whether my [first blog post](https://medium.com/ladies-storm-hackathons/the-gender-gap-as-told-by-data-71dfce420519) would be of any help was daunting.

Over the past year, I've learned and then reaffirmed that writing is as much for others as it is for me. **I like my writing best when it has the dual purpose of helping me self-reflect and helping others learn something new**.

I'm about to embark upon a new phase of my life: my first full-time job. I believe that any big change in one's life demands self-reflection, and, for me, that means writing.

That's why I'm starting **Chronicles of a Junior Dev**. Welcome! 👋

Chronicles of a Junior Dev will be a biweekly log of experiences, mishaps, and takeways from my first year as a software engineer.

**I believe that beginners — like me, a new grad engineer — share the best advice because they remember exactly what it’s like to start from the bottom.** I’ll use Chronicles of a Junior Dev as a place to document my on-the-job growth for my own sake and, most importantly, in the hopes that budding engineers can learn from me.

So join me in my journey from software engineering novice to... well, who knows? Expect new installments in this nail-biter of a life story on every other Monday. 🙀

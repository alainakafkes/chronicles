It's been a little over a month (!!) since I started working at Medium. I've made it through the "I know absolutely nothing" phase, and now I'd place myself on the gradual upward curve of the [Dunning-Kruger effect graph](https://i.stack.imgur.com/aW6bZ.png)... but still near the bottom of that slope of enlightenment.

I'm no senior software engineer, but I have a gained a better grasp on what I do and don't know.

Becoming cognizant of the limits of my knowledge has paradoxically made me feel more independent. In my third or fourth week, I noticed that I was able to work through tasks and build features myself. I can whip up a solution to the problems that I've tackled since then on my own.

As proud as that makes me feel, I am aware that my solutions aren't always the best solutions. In fact, they are often _not_ the best solutions. Sometimes my solutions fall flat because I don't develop them within well-thought-out problem-solving **constraints**.

You bet I just emboldened constraints for a reason. I've long been told that experience distinguishes senior software engineers from their junior counterparts, but I never understood what "experience" meant. I abstractly thought that more years of engineering meant a greater likelihood of exposure to a panoply of problems.

But, last week, I realized that you don't become a senior software engineer just by existing in the industry for a certain number of years. **Senior software engineers are unique in that they have ample experience in determining which rules they must abide by—and which ones they can break—when solving a problem**. Within these constraints, they are able to create code as beautiful as it is functional.

Here are a few examples of what I call constraints:
- This method must be comprehensible for newcomers and veterans alike.
- This codebase must abide by the model-view-controller pattern.
- This UI element must be kept lightweight so that the application runs efficiently.

Why do constraints matter? Well, just as a painter might constrain herself to a canvas of a given size, an engineer who places constraints on a problem must be thoughtful about her solution. **Using with constraints ensures that an engineer will come up with a solution that obeys the appropriate regulations, yes, but also one that will push them to their limits**. Thinking _inside_ of the box fosters both resourcefulness and creativity.

Let me illustrate the difference that constraints make in problem-solving.

When I solve problems, I have trouble wrapping my head around many constraints at once. Maybe I write code that's human-readable but that takes too long to render. Maybe I wrote a method that works, but it over-communicates the details of my code by instantiating unnecessary variables.

So far, I haven't been able to cater to all the right constraints ahead of time. When I submit a pull request for review, it gets flooded with suggestions for improvement.

When a senior software engineer takes on a problem, they reflect upon multiple constraints for a while before even touching the keyboard. This leads to them producing pull requests that require less iteration than my own because they found a good solution by setting multiple (if not all) constraints early on.

Right now, I have no general tips about how to place constraints on problems better. The epiphany that "experience" implies "experience in knowing when to follow and break the rules" rather than "experience in years" still leaves me surprised.

What I can leave you with is this observation: well-scoped constraints set senior software engineers apart from junior engineers. Going forward, I intend to reflect upon as many constraints as I can think of before I write code. I challenge you to do this same.

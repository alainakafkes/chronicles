<p>It’s been a little over a month (!!) since I started working at Medium. I’ve made it through the “I know absolutely nothing” phase, and now I’d place myself on the gradual upward curve of the <a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/aW6bZ.png">Dunning-Kruger effect graph</a>… but still near the bottom of that slope of enlightenment.</p>

<p>I haven’t become a senior software engineer overnight, but I have a gained a better grasp on what I do and don’t know.</p>

<p>Becoming cognizant of the limits of my knowledge has paradoxically made me feel more independent. In my third or fourth week, I noticed that I was able to work through tasks and build features on my own. I can whip up a solution to the problems that I’ve tackled since then on my own.</p>

<p>As proud as that makes me feel, I am aware that my solution isn’t always the best solution. In fact, it is often <em>not</em> the best solution. Only after a code review do I realize that my solution violated the the codebase structure, didn’t adhere to the style guidelines, and/or doesn’t reflect engineering best practices.</p>

<p>Sometimes my solutions fall flat because I don’t come up with them within the appropriate problem-solving <strong>constraints</strong>.</p>

<p>You bet I just emboldened <strong>constraints</strong> (there I go again!) for a reason. I’ve long been told that experience distinguishes senior software engineers from their junior counterparts, but I never understood why. I abstractly thought that, yes, this makes sense because more years of engineers means a greater likelihood of being exposed to a panoply of problems.</p>

<p>But, last week, I realized that you don’t become a senior software engineer just by existing for a certain number of years. Senior software engineers have ample experience in determining which rules they must abide by-and which ones they can break-when solving a problem. Within these constraints, they are able to create something as beautiful as it is functional.</p>

<p>Why do senior engineers put more constraints on their code? Well, besides crafting code that works, senior engineers also have to ensure that the codebase is comprehensible to a newcomer,</p>

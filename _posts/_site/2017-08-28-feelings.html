<p>My first week as a software engineer has been an utter whirlwind. I’ll <em>chronicle</em> (ba-dum tss!) some of the emotions I underwent below, and then list my learnings.</p>

<h2 id="lonely-">Lonely 😞</h2>

<p>Last Saturday, my flight touched down in Oakland International Airport. It wasn’t until then that the whole “new job, new city” thing <em>truly</em> hit me.</p>

<p>My start date was a mere two days later in San Francisco, a city in which I know only a handful of acquaintances. I was lucky that my family flew out with me to the Bay Area; without them present, my sense of aloneness and insignificance would have felt more oppressive. RIP.</p>

<h2 id="self-righteous-">Self-Righteous 🙄</h2>

<p>When I took the BART on Monday morning, I experienced the nagging sensation of being an outsider looking in. From the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bay_Area_Rapid_Transit">BART</a> to the bridges, everything about the Bay Area seemed… wrong. I kept comparing things to Chicago, lamenting ad nauseam that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_%22L%22">the L</a> is cheaper than the BART and that Chicago’s summer weather was better than Berkeley’s. I doubted that San Francisco could ever feel like home.</p>

<h2 id="nervous-">Nervous 😖</h2>

<p>Needless to say, I had reduced myself to a pipsqueak-ish person by the time I walked in the door at work. I work at <a href="https://medium.com/">Medium</a>, a company with less than 100 employees, so my Chicagoan grievances turned into nervousness about fitting in with such a small group and adding value to the product.</p>

<h2 id="welcomed-">Welcomed 😍</h2>

<p>Looking back, my apprehension was understandable but overblown. My team welcomed me with open arms. There was a box of my favorite snacks (!!!) and swag awaiting me on my desk. Even when my mentor went on a brief vacation, every other engineer on my team offered to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pair_programming">pair</a> with me and answer my questions until I got ramped up.</p>

<p>Team aside, I’ve been able to eat lunch and talk with not only my new grad cohort, but also ~10-15 more experienced Medium employees. My engineering manager took me to the lovely <a href="https://www.ashateahouse.com/">Asha Tea House</a> for our first one-on-one, which got me hooked on boba and established a comfortable manager-engineer relationship. Double win.</p>

<h2 id="lucky-">Lucky 😇</h2>

<p>If everyone at Medium has one thing in common, it’s friendliness. This has been said time and time again, but it’s worth repeating: <strong>work culture matters</strong>. As a newcomer to this city, this company, and this line of work, feeling happy and safe at work is a blessing and a privilege.</p>

<h2 id="confused-">Confused 🤔</h2>

<p>Of course, not everything about my first full-time engineering job is peachy. I’m currently working on Medium iOS, and, because my iOS development experience has only been with personal projects, Medium’s vast codebase intimidates the <em>hell</em> out of me. Fortunately, my fellow iOS engineers have been more than willing to bring me back to the light when I get lost in its depths.</p>

<h2 id="proud-">Proud 😎</h2>

<p>Despite my newness to the iOS codebase, I added a small feature that will soon be in production and now I’m working on a second! First <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/">PRs</a> have been a big milestone for me ever since I started contributing to open source, so I celebrated the moment my first contribution was approved.</p>

<h2 id="educational-">Educational 🤓</h2>

<p>Aha. You made it to the last of my emotions! Now, I’ll share with <em>you</em> some of my takeaways from my first week that I think any engineer – perhaps any human? – can learn from.</p>

<p><strong>Ask questions.</strong> Admitting confusion can be a hard step, especially for new engineers who feel self-conscious about not living up to the high expectations that got them hired. Because I’m cognizant of this feeling, I challenge myself to ask questions, because, without them, my growth would be greatly impeded.</p>

<p><strong>Give small companies a chance.</strong> Medium is the first small tech company I’ve ever worked at, and so far, I <em>really</em> like how flexible the teams are and that I’ve already met most of the employees. I anticipate having a highly personalized engineering experience that stretches me where I want to grow, which often doesn’t happen at larger companies.</p>

<p><strong>Check in and check out.</strong> At the end of each day, I write down what I accomplished and what I’d like to accomplish the next day. This has helped me track my progress and remember where I left off, which has improved my productivity. Plus, taking a break from my laptop to write in a journal feels <em>really</em> nice.</p>

<p><strong>Say yes!</strong> Nope, not <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ExHqF1CDkc">to the dress</a>, but to going with your co-workers to do things! This week, I’ve said yes to getting lunch with someone I didn’t know, hunting down food trucks, and picking out team snacks at Trader Joe’s. Taking up these invitations has been quite conducive to having conversations about the non-work part of my co-workers’ lives, which makes me feel even more comfortable at Medium.</p>

<h2 id="settled-">Settled 😌</h2>

<p>I lied, there’s a bonus emotion.</p>

<p>I’ve had a exciting (albeit turbulent!) first week that turned into a weekend full of meeting up with friends old and new. I’m starting to feel more settled as new engineer and new San Franciscan.</p>

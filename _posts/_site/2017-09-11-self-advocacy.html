<p>I’ve been thinking a lot about self-advocacy lately.</p>

<p>I feel lucky to be at Medium – where I have incredible mentors that have been helping me grow as an engineer, as well as the opportunity to work on a product I care about – but sometimes I forget that <em>I</em> am an asset, too. I’ve struggled to balance my gratitude with confidence.</p>

<p>It may seem that all that glitters is gold in tech; the perks of working at a tech company in San Francisco are <em>outrageous</em>, if you haven’t heard. (Especially that tech company avocado stash because WOW. I can never refuse a Californian avocado!)</p>

<p>But beneath the veneer of casual excess, I know that women and other underrepresented folks have <a href="https://medium.com/@amelielamont/not-a-black-chair-8a8e7e2b9140">been</a> <a href="https://www.susanjfowler.com/blog/2017/2/19/reflecting-on-one-very-strange-year-at-uber">screwed</a> by this industry before. That’s why I advocate for myself early and often.</p>

<p>I want to persevere, and I want other women and underrepresented people to succeed, too. In the spirit of our ongoing tenacity, I’ve written two vignettes about my experiences with self-advocacy at Medium, and a bonus one from <a href="https://wafflejs.com/">WaffleJS</a>!</p>

<h2 id="leveling-up-">Leveling Up 🔝</h2>

<p>My engineering manager and I had a conversation about my level, which measures my expertise and, fittingly, my salary. Since I had just started to work two weeks prior, my level had been pre-determined in my offer letter, but my manager nevertheless sat me down to go through the leveling system with her.</p>

<p>I can’t delve into specifics about Medium’s leveling system, but I was pleasantly surprised to discover that it treats engineers as full-on <em>humans</em> rather than code monkeys. To increase one’s level, an engineer needs to demonstrate not only improvements in their technical skills but also in their “soft” skills, such as initiative, communications, mentorship, et cetera. (Take note of the quotations because “soft” skills can be the hard ones!)</p>

<p>Though I feel quite green as a software engineer – especially one who is currently working on iOS – I knew that my past work in developer evangelism and community-building could give me an edge in many of the “soft” skill elements that go into calculating an engineer’s level.</p>

<p>I asked my engineering manager if I could take my ample experience in these “soft” skills into account on my next level assessment, and she responded with an emphatic yes. She suggested that, since that the Medium engineering leadership didn’t know me while I was in college, I should go out of my way to give them strong examples of how I demonstrated these skills.</p>

<p>I hadn’t expected such an enthusiastic response, but I loved it! Besides reminding me that advocating for myself is the clear-cut, <em>right</em> thing to do, she took it a step further by giving me concrete advice on how to make my “soft” skills shine in my next assessment.</p>

<p><strong>Self-advocacy is letting others know the awesome things you’ve done.</strong></p>

<h2 id="speaking-up-">Speaking Up 💬</h2>

<p>I picked up a small feature that I wanted to work on a few days ago, and then cringed in horror at the design mock for it. In my opinion, the mock no longer made sense in the context of new design decisions that had recently been made.</p>

<p>I spun up a quick version of the feature, and then showed two more senior engineers what it looked like. I then spoke my piece about why it felt out place, redundant even. Though I’m a junior engineer, I feel that I have a stake on what direction the iOS app should be taking.</p>

<p>The conversation that ensued confirmed my feelings that the feature was redundant, yes, but my fellow iOS engineers showed me that the feature I was working on was merely a placeholder for a better-designed feature with more sensible functionality. They suggested that since I had taken the initiative to build out this new feature that I should take on the new design.</p>

<p>This will be the most complicated iOS task I’ve done at Medium so far, and the chance to tackle it came from me speaking up to my co-workers with my design opinions. Guess who’s excited to get back to work next week?</p>

<p><strong>Self-advocacy opens doors to opportunity.</strong></p>

<h2 id="standing-up-">Standing Up 🙋🏻</h2>

<p>On Wednesday night, I nervously ambled into a gaggle of food trucks looking for a meetup called WaffleJS. I had applied to speak at WaffleJS about how reading equips engineers to do their jobs better, and magically got my talk accepted despite being new to the meetup and to San Francisco.</p>

<p>After bantering with a handful of other attendees and eating doughnuts (surprise!), I got up on stage to give the first talk of the evening to an audience of about 75 people: the largest crowd I had ever spoken for to date.</p>

<p>Lo and behold, my talk was well-received. When I dropped what was (in my opinion) my most powerful line – “Though we tend to praise ‘geniuses’ in the tech industry, I believe that we should just as strongly exalt people who are curious” – I heard <em>cheers</em> of affirmation.</p>

<p>Damn, did that warm my heart.</p>

<p>Several attendees introduced themselves to me after my talk and told me about things in my talk that had struck them. I even received some book recommendations!</p>

<p>Although technical speaking isn’t everyone’s cup of tea, it’s something I find quite fun. I received even more encouragement from WaffleJS to keep creating spoken and written technical content – encouragement I wouldn’t have received if I hadn’t sent that fateful email to the organizers in July.</p>

<p><strong>Self-advocacy is stepping out of your comfort zone.</strong></p>

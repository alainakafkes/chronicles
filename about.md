Hi! I'm [Alaina](http://alainakafk.es). I'm writing **Chronicles of a Junior Dev** for two key reasons:

* to reflect upon and track my growth as a new software engineer ðŸ“ˆ
* to introduce the ins and outs of an engineering role to budding technologists ðŸŒ±

New posts come out every other Monday.

This blog was built with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), and it is a customization of the [Arctic Fox Theme](https://github.com/diezcami/arctic-fox-theme).
